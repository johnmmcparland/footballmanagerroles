Players of the Football Manager series of games opt to play the football players in their chosen team in one of a variety of different roles.

How well a footballer is suited to a given role is determined by three factors;

  1. The positions the footballer can play
  1. The attributes of the footballer
  1. The attributes required for a given role

This project takes a text file input (generated by the "Print Screen" menu option in the game) parses it and using knowledge of the various roles in the game, recommends the best role to play the footballer in.

It also lists how well each footballer can play in all of the possible roles so the games players can determine how best to balance their squad.
