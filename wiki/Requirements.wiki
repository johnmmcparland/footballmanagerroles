The project aims to allow players of the Football Manager game to determine the best role for their football players by loading a text file, generated by the game.

The requirements are;

   1 Support loading of the "Text file" print-screen from the game (NOTE: This is actually a Rich Text File)
   1 Only recommend a suitable role based on the positions the player can play in (which are written as free text on the output)
   1 Report a "score" of how well a player can play in a given position (100% == have the maximum value, 20, for all the required attributes, however the minimum score is likely to be between 6% and 8% because each attribute can only have a minimum value of 1)
