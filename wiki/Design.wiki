   1 Load the Data Access Object and the required data
   1 Determine whether it is a Football Player or Staff (TBD) parser that is required
   1 Parse out the player / staff member
   1 Calculate the suitability for the various roles
   1 Report the roles

The class diagram is shown in the projects source directory (path trunk/docs/Diagrams/Class.jpg).  It shows the interfaces, enums and classes plus the relationships between them.

   * roles
   * people
   * parsers
   * attributes
   * input

The database contains a number of key tables which are shown in the Entity-Relationship Diagram below.
